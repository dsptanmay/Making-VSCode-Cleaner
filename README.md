# Making VSCode Less Cluttered

VSCode is one of the most popular editors out on the market right now. It was developed by Microsoft and now is being used by millions of users.

Although it is a fantastic editor, at times I felt like it is a bit cluttered and not very pleasant to look at.

I made this guide so that others who feel like me can make their VScode setup less cluttered.
